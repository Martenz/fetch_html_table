In this paper we evaluate two statistical approaches to semi-automated texture enhancement and discrimination for landslide mapping in semi-arid, sedimentary terrain from Daedalus ATM data. A supervised texture discrimination technique is applied, based on calculating similarity between a reference texture spectrum obtained from training samples and spectra from moving image windows. The results are compared with those from interpreting a set of popular texture measures from the literature, derived from grey level co-occurrence matrix statistics Download the Article: Landslide mapping by textural analysis of Daedalus ATM data.

The European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection aims, among other objectives, to ensure a sustainable use of soil. The legal instrument of the strategy, the proposed Framework Directive, suggests identifying priority areas of several soil threats including landslides using a coherent and compatible approach based on the use of common thematic data. In a first stage, this can be achieved through landslide susceptibility mapping using geographically nested, multi-step tiered approaches, where areas identified as of high susceptibility by a first, synoptic-scale Tier (""Tier 1"") can then be further assessed and mapped at larger scale by successive Tiers.

In Conference Proceedings: Proceedings of the 33rd International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment,ISBN 978-0-932913-13-5. Madison WI (United States of America): Omni-Press; 2009. Determination of the spatial extent of peatland is important for the evaluation of soil carbon stocks. At European Level there is a need to provide accurate and updated estimate of the distribution of peatland. Comparison of national data with EU wide land cover mapping shows that there is limited compatibility between the different data sets. The aim of the present study is to test a methodology of standardized mapping and monitoring of peatlands at regional level (national to supra-national bio-climatic regions) based on the enhanced integration of existing thematic maps through GIS analysis in combination with remote sensing, using Estonia as study case.

Soil texture is one of the most important soil properties governing most of the physical, chemical and hydrological properties of soils. Variability in soil texture may contribute to the variation in nutrient storage and availability, water retention and transport and binding and stability of soil aggregates. It can directly or indirectly influence many other soil functions and soil threats such as soil erosion. Geostatistics has been extensively used for quantifying the spatial pattern of soil properties and Kriging techniques are proving sufficiently robust for estimating values at unsampled locations in most of the cases.

Pages 95 - 99 Proceedings of the 9th International Conference of the East and Southeast Asia Federation of Soil Science Societies (ESAFS9), Symposium on Asia-Centric Soil Informatics . 27 october - 28 October 2009, Seoul, Korea. The European Soil Portal is the joint contribution of the European Commission and the European Soil Bureau Network (ESBN) to the building of a thematic spatial data infrastructure for soils. This portal, located at http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu , is the place in which all relevant data and information regarding soils at European level has been collected. It serves also as a vehicle to promote the activities of the European Soil Bureau Network. Spatial data collection and processing within this infrastructure is performed according to emerging ideas behind the INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community. INSPIRE deals, among others, with difficulties to identify, access and use available spatial information in Europe. The European Soil Portal has been considered as a success story of networking different soil information in European level. It is mainly built around the European Soil Database (ESDB), which consists of a number of components of which the Soil Geographical Database of Eurasia (SGDBE) at Scale 1:1,000,000 is one. It is a representation of the diversity and spatial variability of the soil coverage across Europe and its neighbouring countries.

Soil Protection Activities and Soil Quality Monitoring in South Eastern Europe The Conference corresponds with the 60th anniversary work of Dr. Husnija Resulovic, Prof. Emeritus June 18 - 19, 2009 , SARAJEVO, BOSNIA and HERZEGOVINA In the last decade soil and soil protection conferences are becoming recognized as an important environmental topics. The number of recent soil thematic conferences reflects the concern of the scientific community to stress the threats and impose adequate measures for soil protection and preservation. There is a common consensus among the scientists that soil truly is a vital natural resource. By connecting air and water soil is providing essential goods and services and as such represents a fundamental part of terrestrial ecosystems. Western Balkans region is characterized by the extreme diversity of geomorphological conditions. Additionally to geology and relief Alpine, Continental and Mediterranean climates are significantly directing the soil formation processes. The Western Balkans region are facing the same threats as in other parts of European continent. Contamination, sealing, salinization, compaction, erosion and land slides are common in the region. This occasion in Sarajevo is a chance to present the status of soil quality, to review the severity of threats the soil is exposed to and exchange the information on soil protection activities in the Western Balkans and some neighboring states.

Proceedings of the International Forum Celebrating the Centenary of Conservation and Restoration of Soil and Vegetation in Iceland Edited by Harriet Bigas, Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson, Luca Montanarella and Andrés Arnalds. 31 August - 4 September 2007, Selfoss, Iceland. This book highlights how our ability to manage soils plays an important role in global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity reduction, food and water security, and economic and social progress. It explores policy and legal challenges, knowledge management issues, and the crucial role of soil in the successful implementation of the global environmental conventions. The book concludes with the Programme for Action which includes a number of proactive recommendations on how global policies can be improved to protect soil as a resource. The context for this book is the 2007 centennial celebrations of organized conservation and restoration of soil and vegetation in Iceland. As Europe's northernmost nation, Iceland historically suffered acute land degradation problems and through a century of perseverance has now become a world leader in soil restoration research and techniques. A number of international partners and world-class experts on a variety of pertinent fields gathered in Selfoss, Iceland to join in an International Forum. This book outlines the groundbreaking ideas developed by these experts to address the global soil problems and innovative ways to address the combined challenges of soil, society and global change.
