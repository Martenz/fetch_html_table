It is intended for raising awareness of soil biodiversity and its crucial role in sustaining fertility and as a driver of organic matter decomposition and carbon sequestration. The awareness is needed for the proposed Soil Framework Directive by the European Commission in an attempt to prevent further soil degradation across the European Union, and to repair the damage that has already been done.

Timely access to consistent and authoritative data and information is critical to issues such as food production, climate change, water management, energy production and biodiversity. Soil data and information is managed by numerous organisations using a plethora of processes, scales and standards. A number of national and international activities and projects are currently dealing with the issues associated with collation of disparate data sets. Standards are being developed for data storage, transfer and collation like, for example, in the GobalSoilMap.net project, e-SOTER and the EU Inspire GS-SOIL.
